This example contains micro benchmarks to quantify the 
performance overhead caused by the Kieker framework 
components. 

All experiments employ AspectJ for weaving the monitoring 
probes into the application. The Java methods to be 
instrumented are selected using Java annotations.

The default execution of the benchmark requires a 64Bit JVM!

Initially, the following steps are required:
1. You should check whether you installed ant (http://ant.apache.org/), 
   since the execution of all examples described in this 
   README is based on the run-targets in the ant file build.xml.
2. Make sure, that you've installed R (http://www.r-project.org/) to 
   generate the results.
3. Compile the application by calling ant   

Execution of Microbenchmark:
1. bin/run-benchmark-recursive.sh
