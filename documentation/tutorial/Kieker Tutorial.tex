\section{Overview}
\subsection{What is \Kieker?}
\Kieker\ is a framework\footnote{A framework is sort of a library which provides specific and extended functionality} which allows programmers and software engineers the monitoring and analysis of program flows and the runtime behavior of java applications. Normal (``plain'') java applications can be arranged with the framework as well as server based java web applications. The framework itself aims to provide an easy managable and maintanable piece of software, which can be included uncomplicated into existing software projects. While \Kieker\ analyzes the own sourcecode reliably, it causes itself only very less overhead during monitoring.\\
\Kieker\ can be used to put whole method calls on a watch, but single statements (e.g. a = a + 1) as well.

\end{figure}
As can be seen in figure \ref{image:componentdiagram}, the framework consists mainly of two big parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\KiekerMonitoring}\\
This is the part which is responsible for the logging and the recording of the program behavior. The result of this component are the recorded informations which can then be written into different output streams, like for example into files or into a database.
\item \textbf{\KiekerAnalysis}\\
This part is responsible for the evaluation and visualization of the recorded information. It uses the files (or general any collected data which is available as monitoring records) for the analysis and to produce graphs (e.g. Component-Dependency-Graph).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What ist the purpose of this tutorial?}
In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at both, the \textbf{\KiekerMonitoring}- and the \textbf{\KiekerAnalysis}-part. That means, we will describe on the one hand how \KiekerMonitoring\ can be used to mark parts of the own sourcecode for \Kieker\ and to let them execute under surveilance, so that the recorded information can be saved in files. On the other hand we will use \KiekerAnalysis\ to visualize our recorded data.\\
We will show how to create and execute a simple example before we go deeper into the parts of the framework.

\section{Quickstart}
\subsection{Downloading and installing \Kieker}
For the monitoring and analysis of the source code, it is necessary to download the \Kieker\ binaries from \KiekerDownloadUrl\ first. Once that is done, the content of the zip- respectively the tar.gz-file should be extracted to any directory, for example ``$\sim$/kieker'' (under Linux) or ``c:$\backslash$program files$\backslash$kieker'' (under Windows).\\
That is already enough for the ``installation'' of \Kieker.

\subsection{Monitoring}
Now for the creation of a simple example for the use of the \Kieker\ framework. It is recommended to create a new working directory (e.g. $\sim$/example) with the following subdirectories:
\begin{itemize}
\item src (For the sourcecode files)
\item lib (For the libraries and needed jar-files)
\item META-INF (For the configuration files of \Kieker)
\item build (For the builded class files of Java)
\end{itemize}
Before we start with the sourcedoe, we need to copy some files from the \Kieker\ directory to our own working directory\footnote{It would be possible to access the required files within the \Kieker\ directory, but the copying will make the compiling much more comfortable.}.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sim$/kieker/dist/kieker-tpmon-\version\_ctrl.jar to $\sim$/example/lib/kieker-tpmon-\version\_ctrl.jar
\item $\sim$/kieker/dist/kieker-common-\version.jar to $\sim$/example/lib/kieker-common-\version.jar
\item $\sim$/kieker/lib/commons-logging-\version.jar to $\sim$/example/lib/commons-logging-\version.jar
\item $\sim$/kieker/META-INF/tpmon.properties.example to $\sim$/META-INF/\textbf{tpmon.properties}
\item $\sim$/kieker/META-INF/log4j.properties.example to $\sim$/META-INF/\textbf{log4j.properties}
\end{itemize}
The last two files are configuration files. For a quick start they are already configurated correctly.
