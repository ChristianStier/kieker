	- dynamic runtime performance characteristics of resources
	
	
	that comprise an I/T environment to design algorithms for rapid root
	cause identification in case of problems.
	
	
	IN THE EVENT OF A REPORTED PROBLEM, our approach uses the dependency
	information and the behavior
	
	models to NARROW DOWN THE ROOT CAUSE to a small set of resources that
	can be individually tested,
	
	thus facilitating quick remediation and thus leading to reduced administrative

  review = {Focus on soft-faults (violation of agreed levels of service).
	
	
	Used term: Service level agreements (SLAs)
	
	
	Combining RUN-TIME PERFORMANCE modeling of system COMPONENTS with
	the study of their DEPENDENCIES.
	
	facilitate the rapid isolation of causes when user transactions manifest
	unacceptably slow response time (Root Cause Detection after user
	SLA violation).
	
	
	1. Introduction
	
	- The monitoring data, say RESPONSE TIME, is collected from individual
	components and compared against THRESHOLDS preset by a system administrator.
	
	- Thresholds are hard to preset, especially in the event of SUDDEN
	WORKLOAD CHANGES, and their use often results in SPURIOUS EVENTS.
	
	- The PRIMARY CONTRIBUTION of this paper is that, we DYNAMICALLY CONSTRUCT
	RESPONSE TIME BASELINES for each component by observing its behavior.
	
	- When SLA monitor observes an END-TO-END RESPONSE TIME VIOLATION
	due to some degradation inside the system, the individual COMPONENTS
	ARE automatically RANKED
	
	 in the order of the violation degree of their current response time
	level with their constructed good behavior baseline and of their
	dependency information.
	
	 A system administrator can then scan the limited set of ranked components
	and quickly determine the actual root cause through more detailed
	examination of the individual components.
	
	 The net gain here is that the administrator would need to examine
	far fewer components for the actual ROOT CAUSE, than conventional
	management approaches.
	
	
	Management system designed in three tiers.
	
	1. Plaform-specific monitoring agents
	
	2. Online mining engine extracts dependencies and stores them in DB
	
	3. Management applications such as problem determination application
	
	
	Idea:
	
	 1. SLA monitor observes end-to-end RESPONSE TIME VIOLATION
	
	 2. Individual COMPONENTS RANKED in order of violation degree of their
	current response time level
	
	 3. Admin can scan limited set of ranked components to detect ROOT
	CAUSE
	
	
	2. Background
	
	Dependencies between components
	
	
	3. Related Work
	
	- We generate the BEHAVIOR CHARACTERISTICS of the monitored components
	based on HISTORICAL MEASURMENTS and STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES,
	
	 distinguishing between the GOOD BEHAVIOR MODEL and the BAD BEHAVIOR
	MODEL.
	
	
	4. Behavior Modeling Using Dependency Graphs
	
	- assume an end-user SLA with an END-TO-END RESPONSE TIME THRESHOLD
	specified for each transaction type
	
	- describe how one can CONSTRUCT DYNAMIC THRESHOLDS for the internal
	components by OBSERVING THEIR RESPONSE TIME BEHAVIOR.
	
	
	4.1 Monitoring
	
	- introduce the concept of DYNAMIC THRESHOLDS
	
	- dynamic threshold computation uses an AGGREGATE MONITORING INFRASTRUCTURE
	and AGGREGATE DEPENDENCY GRAPHS.
	
	- uses data from HTTP Server logs, WAS Performance Monitoring Infrastructure
	(PMI), and DB2 Snapshot API.
	
	
	4.2 Behavior Modeling
	
	- goal: construct a DYNAMIC THRESHOLD of a component, such that WHEN
	an END-TO-END PROBLEM is DETECTED,
	
	 the current response time samples from the component may be COMPARED
	with its dynamic threshold.
	
	- transaction types can have two states: GOOD, BAD (below or above
	SLA)
	
	- system components have two states: GOOD, BAD (cause of problem or
	affected by problem elsewhere)
	
	- traditional system: HARD-CODED THRESHOLD configured FOR EACH COMPONENT,
	each component sends event
	
	 -> large number of events
	
	- Our management system uses AVERAGE RESPONSE TIME SAMPLES from the
	COMPONENTS to build their bad or good state performance models.
	
	- A KEY FEATURE OF OUR SYSTEM is that it uses the DEPENDENCY GRAPH
	to CLASSIFY RESPONSE TIME SAMPLES from a component
	
	 into BAD AND GOOD STATE, instead of hard-coded thresholds on individual
	components.
	
	- The GOOD BEHAVIOR MODEL is an AVERAGE OF THE GOOD RESPONSE TIME
	VALUES and also SERVES AS THE DYNAMIC THRESHOLD.
	
	- Query Q2: If T1 and T2 are in good state, the sample is added to
	the good model of Q2
	
	- In our current implementation, the CUMULATIVE RESPONSE TIME OF A
	COMPONENT obtained
	
	 from the monitoring infrastructure is used as the model variable.
	
	
	 This response time INCLUDES the RESPONSE TIME of the child components.
	
	
	5. Problem Determination
	
	- In this section we discuss how components may be RANKED, so that
	a system administrator may investigate them in sequence to determine
	the actual bottleneck.
	
	- When a problem occurs at a component, the dependent transactions
	are affected and all components that are in the transaction's sub-tree
	start computing a bad
	
	 behavior model
	
	- Each component is assigned a SEVERITY VALUE, which captures the
	FACTOR by which the BAD MODEL DIFFERS FROM THE GOOD BEHAVIOR MODEL
	or DYNAMIC THRESHOLD of the
	
	 component.
	
	- AGAIN: Use cumulative response times
	
	- Rank components
	
	
	6. Experimental Evaluation
	
	- SLA monitor intercepts all requests and responses at HTTP server
	
	- Besides, the behavior modeling and PD based on the dynamic thresholds,
	is also NOT HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE LOAD.},

 abstract             = {Manual failure diagnosis in large-scale software systems is time-consuming and error-prone. Automatic failure diagnosis support mechanisms can potentially narrow down, or even localize faults within a very short time which both helps to preserve system availability. A large class of automatic failure diagnosis approaches consists of two steps: 1) computation of component anomaly scores; 2) global correlation of the anomaly scores for fault localization. In this paper, we present an architecture-centric approach for the second step. In our approach, component anomaly scores are correlated based on architectural dependency graphs of the software system and a rule set to address error propagation. Moreover, the results are graphically visualized in order to support fault localization and to enhance maintainability. The visualization combines architectural diagrams automatically derived from monitoring data with failure diagnosis results. In a case study, the approach is applied to a distributed sample Web application which is subject to fault injection.},

This paper introduces an approach and implementation to the continuous monitoring and on demand visualization of software behavior, with a focus on multi-user Java Web applications. Our tool, called Kieker, monitors response times and control-flow for selected operations of a software application. The monitoring overhead is intended to be small enough to continuously monitor a selection of operations during normal operation. Besides monitoring, Kieker offers the reconstruction and visualization of models of current or past software system behavior in terms of UML Sequence Diagrams, Markov chains, Component Dependency Graphs, Trace Timing Diagrams, as well as Execution and Message trace models.},

 abstract             = {Operation response times in software systems are typically modeled by probability distributions. However, particularly in Java EE applications, operation response time distributions are often of high variance or multi-modal. Such characteristics reduce confidence or applicability in various statistical evaluations. We observed that calling-context information, e.g., the complete call path within the system, is often connected to a significant part of this variance and other undesired distribution characteristics. This paper introduces an approach to analyzing operation response times in the context of the complete call trace. This results in response time distributions that are specific to trace-contexts. We present empirical results of a medium-size online store demo application on the benefits of using trace-context specific response time distributions. The results are compared to the use of other or no calling-context information. Empirical support is presented that trace-context analysis can create response time distributions with lower variance compared to using less or no calling-context information. Based on trace-context analysis, multi-modal distributions could be replaced by multiple unimodal distributions.},

 abstract             = {One of the challenging problems for software developers is guaranteeing that a system as built is consistent with its architectural design. In this paper, we describe a technique that uses runtime observations about an executing system to construct an architectural view of the system. In this technique, we develop mappings that exploit regularities in system implementation and architectural style. These mappings describe how low-level system events can be interpreted as more abstract architectural operations and are formally defined using colored Petri nets. In this paper, we describe a system, called DiscoTect, that uses these mappings and we introduce the DiscoSTEP mapping language and its formal definition. Two case studies showing the application of DiscoTect suggest that the tool is practical to apply to legacy systems and can dynamically verify conformance to a preexisting architectural specification},

The workload to be generated is specified in two types of models. An application model specifies the possible interactions with the Web-based software system, as well as all required low-level protocol details by means of a hierarchical finite state machine. Based on the application model, the probabilistic usage is specified in corresponding user behavior models by means of Markov chains. Our tool Markov4JMeter implements our approach to probabilistic workload generation by extending the popular workload generation tool JMeter. A case study demonstrates how probabilistic workload for a sample Web application can be modeled and executed using Markov4JMeter.},
