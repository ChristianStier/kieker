\chapter{\KiekerAnalysisPart{} Component}\label{chap:componentsAnalysis}

\NOTIFYBOX{The Java sources of this chapter can also be found in the %
\file{\customComponentsBookstoreApplicationDirDistro{}/} directory of the %
binary release.}

	% Notify-tag; this is more or less a reminding.
	\class{\KiekerAnalysisPart} is the part of \Kieker\  which is responsible for the analysis, consisting of the reader, the consumer and the analysis controller itself. To read the stored records again is task of the readers. Whatever is done with these informations is task of the consumers. They can evaluate, process or visualize the data for example. The analysis instance concerns about the lifetime and registration of the other parts.

\

 \NOTIFYBOX{As explained in the example chapter, the analysis consists  of the following steps:
	\begin{compactenum}
		\item Creating an instance \class{AnalysisController} class
		\item Registering the analysis plugins
		\item Registering the monitoring log reader
		\item Starting the analysis instance.
	\end{compactenum}}

\section{Monitoring Log Readers}\label{sec:analysis:reader}

		% Warning-tag for the reader-writer-thing
		The monitoring log readers are the direct counterpart to the monitoring log writers. While a writer gets a record and writes it into files or somewhere else, the reader takes the written data and converts it into a suitable instance of \class{AbstractKiekerMonitoringRecord}.

\

\WARNBOX{This means that whenever a new writer is implemented, a corresponding reader has to be implemented as well. If one want for example to store the recorded informations in a database, one should be capable of reading these saved informations from the database again.}

\

		\noindent There are already some readers implemented in \Kieker\  as can be seen in the hierarchy diagram in Figure \ref{Figure:ReaderHierarchy}.

		% This image shows the reader hierarchy.

			\end{centering}
		\end{figure}

		\noindent The implementation of an own reader is nearly the same as the implementation of the writer, but to keep things simple, it is recommended to extend the already implemented AbstractKiekerMonitoringLogReader, because otherwise it would be necessary to implement the employed observer pattern of the reader. By using the methods of the abstract class \class{kieker.analysis.reader.AbstractMonitoringLogReader}, the task of delivering a new record to the consumers can be delegated to the super class.\\
		Listing~\ref{listing:MyReader} shows a simple reader which reads a stored record from the pipe. If there is nothing on the pipe to be read, the reader waits 4 seconds at maximum before it terminates.

	\section{Record Consumer Plugins}\label{sec:analysis:consumer}

		The consumers are the parts of Kieker which work with the records that have been loaded by the reader. There can be (theoretically) an infinite number of consumers which produce any kind of output. A consumer can be programmed by implementing the interface \class{kieker.analysis.plugin.IMonitoringRecordConsumerPlugin} and writing the necessary methods. Following example consumer takes the given record and writes the content to the default output stream.

	\section{Analysis Controller}\label{sec:analysis:controller}

		To put everything together, Listing \ref{listing:AnalysisController} shows how to use the above-mentioned components.
